# Advent of code 2023

This repo stores my solutions of tasks from 2023's advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/2023).

My goal is to use as many languages to solve the tasks as I can. I'll mostly code in those that I have at least some experience with, but, who knows, I might try out something completely new!

## Need to know

In my solutions, I take one thing as a given – the input file structure. Therefore, there is no error checking for parsing.

## Languages used

- Day 1 – Python
- Day 2 – C#
- Day 3 – C#
- Day 4 – Haskell
- Day 5 – Java (this is pretty neat)
